# toy_snake

## Requirements

Fixed:
* input and output files (apart from initial data ingestion)
* order of steps

Modular:
* For each step should be easily interchangable (as a user):
  * the python code
  * the parameters
  * the conda env / container
* Platform (local, HPC) - at step or at workflow level?

Should QC metrics be modular or fixed?

Support for AIND capsules (which are nextflow?)
